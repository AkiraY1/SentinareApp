# Sentinare Contact Tracing

This is a simple web app that utilizes AltumView's API to identify potential contacts between people who may have been infected with COVID-19 in senior homes that use Sentinare cameras. A graph is produced that intuitively displays potential ways people could have spread COVID-19. The web app is very lightweight and only asks for basic information from the user.
